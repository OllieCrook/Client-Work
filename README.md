## Home Project
I have also been working on a home automation project with my Father using **Home Assistant**, an open-source **Python 3** based program running on a **Raspberry Pi 3** running **Raspbian OS**. I use this as a central control point for the various smart and internet connected devices in the home without having to rely on 3rd party cloud services.

* Configured using YAML,
* All setup via PuTTY to use the linux Terminal,
* Setup SSH,
* Setup SSL,
* Used Let's Encrypt and DuckDNS,
* Setup Z-Wave,
* Setup MQTT Broker,
* Connected to a variety of API's (We have over 30 devices),
* Setup my own Google Assistant to connect the Google Assistant built into the latest Android phones in order to allow control from your mobile phone,
* Setup Raspbian to auto boot the terminal running Home Assistant, a terminal running HADashboard+AppDaemon and Chrome into Kiosk mode.
* Containerised all of the individual components as docker instances for easier installation and management.
